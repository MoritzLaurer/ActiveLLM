# ActiveLLM

This repository provides experimental code for combining active learning with generative language models. 

The main class for the active learning loop is implemented in `active_learning.py`.
The code can be tested in the `ActiveLLM_demo.ipynb` notebook.

As active learning loops with generative Transformers are very compute intensive, the notebook is intended to be run on a GPU in google colab. Test the notebook here:

Note that this code is unfinished and experimental.
